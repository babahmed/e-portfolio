        <h1 class="heading">Initial Post :- Collaborative Discussion 1: Project Failures Study</h1>
        <p>What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?.</p>
  
        <p> 1.  Poor communication and incompetent project manager.</p>
        <p> 2. Inadequate organization support and task definitions.</p>
        <p> 3. Lack of adequate knowledge.</p>

        <p> “Give two examples of failures that support your choices (there are several examples in the lecturecast).”</p>
        <p> An important case study is the issue of a medium-sized international software product company. The company releases new software versions regularly and its products can be characterized as complex model-based software. The failure of the case was that blocker-type defects of the program are often detected after the product releases (Lehtinen et al, 2014). This project's failure is due to the lack of adequate skills required and knowledge in testing and having code quality control in the case of adding new codes to the old ones. Developers and testers should identify this common error during the development and testing phase, but they didn't.</p>
        <p> Another Case Study is a medium-sized international software product company with approximately 100 employees. The product is delivered for the customers through installation projects that occasionally include the development of new features. New software versions are released regularly. The failure selected for analysis in the case was that the installation projects are too challenging to be performed efficiently. This project failure was due to lack of communication and incompetent project managers who has failed to develop a method of creating checklists and simplifying the installation process which could have minimize the failure. </p>

          Hi Babatunde
         </p>
        <p>
          I think you make some excellent points in your post. I have two questions: Do you think automated or structured testing (such as unit tests and linters) could help? With your second case study are you familiar with advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks (an example being the solar winds exploit). Do those kinds of attacks change your view of the responsibilities for failures?

        <h1 class="heading">Collaborative Discussion 1:  Response to Doug Millward</h1>
        <p>In my opinion, I believe it can help. Automated testing is relatively a new approach to software testing which guarantee and ensures quality test at all times. Automated testing is a very critical model of continuous testing which ensures continuous testing of the software components at all time when the need arises. With automated testing, rather than performing a big bang critical testing at the end of the software development life cycle it happens in small pieces (Step by step) when the need for testing arises. </p>
        <p>Concerning the second case study, in my opinion it does. Advance persistent threat are not random threat because it requires excessive resources than a standard web application attack. Advance Persistent Attacks are being initiated by team of competent and experienced cybercriminals with enough and substantial financial banking. Most of which are government funded used as cyber warfare weapons. Those attackers usually establish an illicit, long-term presence on a network in order to mine highly sensitive data. The target of these attacks are usually carefully chosen, researched and assessed. With these kind of attacks, I concur to the opinion that such attacks are not responsible for software failure.</p>

        <p>
          
          Hi Babatunde,
         </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for your sharing. Those two case studies are pretty impressive to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          
          For the first case, I have the same views as you. I believe source code management and testing are essential for a successful project. You proposed automating testing to ensure continuous testing, which is a suitable methodology. Developers often forget stuff even though they had written the program. I also suggest using Git technology to manage the source code for better code management. A well-documented source version control can be easier to track all changes made for the project, and it is much easier to revert to the last stable version (Atlassian, N.D.). If developers make mistakes and pollute the code base, they can roll back to the previous commit in a convenient way (Brent Laster, 2018.). Do you think it is a good idea to manage the code base using Git?
        </p>

        <h1 class="heading">Collaborative Discussion 2:  Response to Yin</h1>
        <p>Hospitals are evolving into a paperless environment with the introduction of electronic health records (EHR) for patients. Currently, Epic is one oft he major software providers for EHR. However, the existing system faces
          challenges in data sharing, data compliance and data security (Rosenbaum,2015). </p>
        <p>The medical industry has become the target of hackers for whom medical identity theft by the unlawful access to electronic health records (EHR) is a new lucrative business. Healthcare hacking has become an epidemic because medical data is more valuable than financial information. Data stolen from a bank quickly becomes useless once the breach is discovered and the passcodes are changed. However, healthcare data, which includes medical histories and personal identification, can last a lifetime. The information collected can be used for ransom, to commit tax frauds, to provide supporting disability documentation, to send fake bills to insurance providers, to obtain healthcare, prescription drugs, medical treatment, and to obtain government benefits like Medicare and medicaid.</p>
        <p>Numerous medical devices commonly used today may be vulnerable to unauthorized access. For example, there are programmable, implantable, internal and external biomedical devices (such as pacemakers, defibrillators, insulin pumps, pain management pumps, vagus nerve stimulators, and spinal cord stimulators) that are susceptible to hacking. Intrusions may lead to the compromise of confidential patient data or loss of control of the device itself, which may be fatal (Frenger, 2012).</p>
        <p>Security vulnerabilities are severe in wireless connected devices, where not only the confidentiality of the patients data is at risk but also the processing of unauthorized commands. Although many patients benefit from these implantable devices, their number, connectivity, and especially remote-communication increase their security vulnerabilities (Maisel, 2010). In 2011, cyber security researcher J. Radcliffe found vulnerabilities in a drug infusion pump that a hacker could exploit to alter the drug dosage, even to a fatal dose, without the pump issuing an alert (Goodin, 2011; Radcliffe, 2011).</p>
        <p>There's a heightened awareness of Cyber security in medical devices in the regulatory landscape. As an industry, Medtronic is taking a holistic approach to the issue by continually performing internal and external testing and ongoing monitoring, remediation, collaboration with regulatory organizations, development of contingency planning and incident response management, and working with ethical hackers and IT experts to create a winning strategy (McGee, 2013).</p>
        <p>Many of the best security practices can be leveraged, such as hardening the systems, using secure protocols for communication or installing the latest updates, fixes and patches. Innovators need to consider that future security will be managed automatically by the system instead of users, and designing secure technology will require a new approach and a growth mindset. Kevin Fu, a graduate researcher at the University of Michigan whose research focuses on cyber security in medical devices, emphasizes that while this is a growing fear, it should be viewed in perspective, considering that most patients experience tremendous gain from the implantation of the device, far greater than the associated risk from a security breach. There are many facets to the problem: devices using outdated operating systems are easy targets for malware, plugging unverified USBs into devices, lack of safety awareness in hospital settings and many more. Despite all the security gaps existing, Fu is of the opinion that the benefits of medical devices to patients who desperately need them far outweigh the security hazards that potentially exist and that can and should be addressed (HealthTrust, 2015).</p>

        <h1 class="heading">Initial Post :- Collaborative Discussion 2: Factors affecting user experience</h1>
        
        <p>The expression of human experience to a phenomenon often tends to be subject and relative and over time changes with much familiarity with the concept or object. Kujala, S. (2011) examined that the definition of user experience is lacking on a generally acceptable ground due to its multidimensional nature. The human experience is embodied in emotions and this emotion, speaks of our judgemental stance on the experience we have had.</p>
  
        <p> This emotion, replete itself in the experience and interaction with technology. From our visual aspect, we often give judgements that changes in the course of a continuous experience of the technology. As Minge and Thurge (2018) noted, there are two products relation emotion which can further be subdivided into the; initial and later stages. </p>
        <p> The first stage talks about the visual appeal of the product as it presents itself to us while the second stage speaks of the Influence associated with the constant use of the product. Herein, it moves from a stage of visual appeal to a detailed experience.  Minge and Thurge (2018) call this the; hedonic halo effect(beautiful is usable) and the pragmatic halo effect(usable is beautiful). </p>
        <p> As a suggestion to build user experience and interface a product, the development of UI basically will develop the user experience and this includes layout, design, and prototyping. Prototype links all product screens together and allows users to explore products. It is used to showcase products to stakeholders, understand developers, and collect feedback from potential users.</p>


        <p>Kujala, S, &  Roto, V, & Vaananen-Vainio-Mattila, K, & Karapanos, E, & Sinnela 2011, 'UX Curve: A method for evaluating long-term user experience, Interacting with Computers 23 (2011) 473–483 </p>

        <p>
          Having read your contribution on how human emotions can affect users' experience with the technology available to the user at the first instance, and then after an experience of it for some time, I will agree with your point as examined by (Minge and Thüring, 2018), that these experience changes over time and is affected by emotions.
         </p>
        <p>
          However, since you agreed that all human experiences have a wide range of emotions in our everyday lives, it follows thus that these emotions must have been triggered by something for them to be revealed. For example, when someone does the right thing as expected of me, I will be happy. Using this analogy of a cause for an effect, I would like to know what factors will affect a user's emotion(dichotomy of; (good/bad, pleasant or unpleasant, etc.) toward technology away from its visual appeal at its first instance and affect its usage for awhile. I feel that our emotional judgement is necessitated by different factors hence, the need for this critical question and reflection. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the solution proposed in the context of the discussion, I will agree with you that with the use of the search engine 'Google', one can easily search for the visual representation of the technology or product and get more familiar with it. In this way, it will build the user experience emotion in getting new to the technology.

        <p>
          The term user experience has gained much popularity these days. However, regarding its definition and scope, there is still no definite answer. Law et. al. (2009) has conducted a survey on 275 researchers and practitioners. Authors recommended the term to be scoped to products, systems, services, and objects that a person interacts with through a user interface.
         </p>
        <p>
          As Minge and Thuring (2018) pointed out, there are hedonic halo effect ('beautiful is usable') and a pragmatic halo effect ('usable gets beautiful) during interaction with a product. The CUE model in figure 1 tried to summarize the components of user experiences into three categories, namely perception of non-instrumental qualities, emotional reactions, and perception of instrumental qualities. In my opinion, this is generally true. However,  it is worth noting that the perception of instrumental qualities is very subjective. A system may be useful to a group of users but not the others as they may have different needs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, I would suggest to add Persona to the components of user experience. People of similar background and traits may have more similar reactions towards the interaction with the interface.
